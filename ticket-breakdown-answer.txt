Sample Data Model: 

Facilities
  - Facility Id (Primary Key)
  - Facility Name

Agents
  - Agent Id (Primary Key)
  - Agent Name

Shifts
  [Note: This table will have composite primary Key of Facility Id and Agent Id ]
  - Facility Id (Primary Key)
  - Agent Id (Primary Key)
  - Custom Agent Id (*** New Id Added by Facilities to identify the Agent ***)
  - Shift Start Time
  - Shift End Time

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overall plan: 
1. Facilities will Generate New Custom Agent Id when a new Shift Request comes.
2. New Custom Agent Id will get stored in the shifts table against every shift entry.
3. 'getShiftsByFacility' will only send Custom Agent Id back to the caller. 
   The database Agent Id should not be present in the response.
4. 'generateReport' will only have the Custom Agent Id.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ticket 1: Generate Custom Agent Id for Every New Agent 

Description: Facilities will generate a new Custom Agent Id for every new Agent 
when he sends a request for a shift.

Acceptance Criteria: 
1. For New Agent Request, Custom Id should be created. 
2. Mapping between Agent Database Id and Custom Agent Id should be established.
3. For Existing Agent Request, same Custom Id should be used.

Effort Estimation: 
  - 16 hours work (including unit test case writing and execution)

Implementation Details: 
1. Create a mapping table between Agent Database Id and New Custom Agent Id.
2. When an agent sends a request for new shift entry to any facility for the first time, 
   create a new Id (based on any logic. It can be uuid or combination of their first and last name, etc).
3. Add a new mapping entry for New Custom Agent Id vs Agent Database Id.
4. When an agent sends a request for new shift entry to any facility for subsequent times, fetch this 
   Custom Id from the mapping.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ticket 2: Attach New Custom Agent Id in every Shift Entry

Description: When a new Shift entry is recorded for every Agent, the Custom Agent Id, generated 
by the Facilities should be inserted in the database for every record. 

Acceptance Criteria: 
1. Fetch Custom Agent Id for the Agent. 
2. Insert the Custom Agent Id in every Shift Record.

Effort Estimation: 
  - 8 hours work (including unit test case writing and execution)

Implementation Details: 
1. Create a new database column for Custom Agent Id.
2. Fetch the Custom Agent Id for the Agent from the Facilities when the request for adding new Shift comes.
3. Add the Custom Agent Id in the Shift table record. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ticket 3: Fetch Custom Agent Id when Shifts are fetched based on the Facilities

Description: When request for 'getShiftsByFacility' comes, the Custom Agent Id should be present in 
the response for every Shift Record.

Acceptance Criteria: 
1. Custom Agent Id should be present in the response for every Shift Record while fetching shifts based on facility id.

Effort Estimation: 
  - 6 hours work (including unit test case writing and execution)

Implementation Details: 
1. In the Database Search Query to fetch all shifts based on the facility id, 
  add a new result field to return Custom Agent Id. 
2. Do not send Database Agent Id as it is not needed in the Report.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ticket 4: Custom Agent Id should be present in the Report pdf File. 

Acceptance Criteria: Custom Agent Id should be present while generating the final report based 
  on 'getShiftsByFacility' shifts. 

Effort Estimation: 
  - 4 hours work (including unit test case writing and execution)

Implementation Details: 
1. Fetch the Shift details given by the getShiftsByFacility function.
2. Use the Custom Agent Id returned from this function in every shift record while generating the pdf report.
